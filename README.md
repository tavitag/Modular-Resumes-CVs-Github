# Welcome to the Modular reume's and CV's Github!
This project is for everyone that hates updating their resume! So most of us. Now that I have your attention, this project aims to create a platform that allows a user to create a customized resume or CV for a job application in under 5 minutes. In this platform, users can list experiences, associated skills, dates, contact information, associated media, and a desccription. Ideally, when you want to apply for a job, use a keyword search in the database to bring up experiences, check a box, and populate a document with customized experiences.
